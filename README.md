# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: It refers to the systematic application of engineering principles and tools for development and maintenance of high quality software system.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Traditional programming was mainly centered around the code while software engineering extends to the entire life cycle of the software.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): It refers to a structured process that is used to design and develop websites and its phases include Design, implementation, recquirements,testing,deployment and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirement - I involes gathering and documenting user needs and the system requirements
Testing -It refers to conducting tests to ensure the software meets,quality standardsand also its functional requirements
Deployment- it refers to realising the software to custostomers
Implementation- it refers to building thesoftware according to design and the specifications
Mainenance -It refers to providing updates and support after deployment 
Design -it refers to creating a high level and detailed designs
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Agile- it refers to iteractive approach focused on collaboration, flexibily and rspongding to change
Waterfall model -It refers to sequential approach involving distinct phases such as design,requirement,implementation flowiwing in a sequence downwards.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
waterfall model is sequencial while agile is not sequential and is main;y focused on colaboration
Waterfall is mainly applicable where the project is not big and the application requirements are not changing while agile is mainly applucable where the project is big and requires collaboration of diferent individuals
                                            
Requirements Engineering: It refers to the process of identifying ,analysing validatinng and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:It refers to the process of identifying ,analysing validatinng and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system . It tells anyone in the project what he/she is supposed to carry out.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
It refers to separating  softwaare design process into modules for smooth handling of the process and enhancing collaboration
 How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? It facilitates ease in management and understanding complex systems by breaking it down into small understandable parts
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Unit testing- It refers to testing individual modules
Integration testing- It involves testng interaction between different components
Version Control Systems:
It refes to testing the sofware against user requirements to be sure that it meets user needs

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.It refers to the process of tracking changes in a software code. An example is git .is features are it is scalable,branching is easier, its free and open source.
Software Project Management:It refers to the planning and supervising software projects

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
